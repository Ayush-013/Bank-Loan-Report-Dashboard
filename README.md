DESCRIPTION

Welcome to my portfolio project, Data Analysis of Bank Loan Report. This project showcases my expertise in combining Power BI and SQL to create a dynamic and interactive Bank Loan Report Dashboard. The dashboard is designed to integrate data seamlessly, providing real-time insights and enabling a data-driven approach to business analytics and strategic decision-making.

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and distinguish between 'Good and Bad loans', offering detailed insights that can help reduce losses due to Bad loans. Through comprehensive data analysis, I have developed a system that not only highlights patterns and trends but also provides actionable recommendations to improve the overall loan approval process and minimize financial risk.

By leveraging advanced data visualization techniques in Power BI and robust data management with SQL, this project demonstrates my ability to handle complex datasets, draw meaningful conclusions, and present them in a clear and visually appealing manner. The resulting dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to make informed decisions and enhance the financial stability of the banking institution.
